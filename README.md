# Alarm

Simple alarm clock using Python, that shows the time if the current time is not the time at which the alarm has been set and it opens a randomly selected YouTube video from a text file in which the links of the videos have been provided, once the current time is the alarm time.

This was done for the project mentioned in the following link:
